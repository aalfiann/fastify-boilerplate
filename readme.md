### Concepts
Our goal is to create a web application that scales well (horizontal scale), strong in high traffic.

- **Stateless**  
  Authentication is stateless with JWT Token, this is the important thing to achieve horizontal scale.
- **No Cookie**  
  Session is saved to localStorage at client browser.
- **Built-in API**  
  Server just render the page and using ajax to get data from API.
- **MongoDB**  
  MongoDB is horizontal, scale-out architecture can support huge volumes of both data and traffic.
- **Cache in Memory**  
  Cache in memory (support redis) could make request faster and save the traffic/bandwidth to MongoDB.

### Security
- **JWT Authentication**  
  JWT Token is using RS256 with private and public key signature (required to use SSL).

- **Routes with schema validation**  
  Any payload send to the server is validated.

- **Safe from MongoDB Injection**  
  Any input data already validated by mongoose schemas.

- **Safe from XSS**  
  Template engine and Reactive UI (Reef) has already encoded the markup.

- **Safe from CSRF**  
  Any request in admin/user area is required token by JWT.

- **Error handler for 4xx and 5xx**  
  Any internal error is handled automatically by Fastify.
